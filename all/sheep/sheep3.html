      <h1>sheep3.js demo page</h1>
      <p>
        <a class="link" href="/sheep3.js">sheep3.js</a> is the third and current
        version of the little sheep watermark in the bottom right corner of the
        page. It's the successor of
        <a class="link" href="./sheep2.html">sheep2.js</a>, and has been used
        for almost all web pages created after 2018-12-14.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike its predecessors, sheep3.js is relatively featureless. This was
        intentional because I felt like sheep2.js had way more features than
        were necessary. Nonetheless, it was also out of laziness, and I plan on
        adding
        <a
          class="link"
          href="https://github.com/SheepTester/sheeptester.github.io/issues/45"
          >parity with sheep2.js</a
        >
        in the future without compromising its minimalism.
      </p>

      <h2>Little sheep features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Clicking on the little sheep brings you to the home page.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The little sheep is keyboard accessible.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Style documentation</h2>
      <p>
        The little sheep is a custom <code>&lt;sheep-btn&gt;</code> element, so
        it can be hidden by adding:
      </p>
      <pre>
sheep-btn {
  display: none;
}</pre
      >
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
