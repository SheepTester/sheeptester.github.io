    <h2 class="glow reveal">Other name things</h2>
    <p class="content reveal">My name means nothing to me, and it holds no cultural significance.</p>
    <p class="content reveal">My parents named me after a character in <em>The Sixth Sense</em>; I haven’t watched the movie yet though. They realized my name was hard for native Chinese speakers to pronounce, so they chose an easier one for my brother.</p>
    <p class="content reveal">I like my name because it’s short and monosyllabic, but perhaps it could be shorter and more intuitive to spell (eg San, Sa, S?), but then it might look too Chinese and affect some people’s initial perceptions before meeting me. I prefer Irish spelling because it’s shorter.</p>

    <div id="definitions" class="reveal">
      <button class="def-arrow" id="left"></button>
      <button class="def-arrow" id="right"></button>
      <div class="definition def-1 showing">
        <h3 class="def-by glow">Ethnically</h3>
        <p class="content">I would call myself Taiwanese and more generally Asian but distinctively not Chinese because their government makes them undesirable. I also identify as Californian but not American for similar reasons.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="definition def-2">
        <h3 class="def-by glow">Zodiac</h3>
        <p class="content">Conveniently, my Western and Chinese zodiacs are both sheep. I like sheep because they're cute, fluffy, and recognizable.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="definition def-3">
        <h3 class="def-by glow">Age</h3>
        <p class="content">2003-04-09 is an acceptable date to be born on because it all has single digits, but this makes writing it ambiguous (4/9 is either April 9 or September 4). Being the oldest sibling is acceptable because I get to get through school before they make it worse: I narrowly avoided CAASPP testing in fifth grade and I nearly was able to avoid the SELF program and have Dunbar in Gunn. However, it means my parents use me as a test subject for my younger brother.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="definition def-4">
        <h3 class="def-by glow">Interests</h3>
        <p class="content">I can develop for the front end of websites and make pretty cool web apps and games like <a href="https://sheeptester.github.io/gunn-student-sim/">Gunn Student Simulator</a>, <a href="https://sheeptester.github.io/olamreee/">OlamREEE</a>, and <a href="https://orbiit.github.io/gunn-web-app/">UGWA</a>. I’m also interested in conlangs and linguistics.</p>

    </div>

    <h2 class="glow reveal">Success story</h2>
    <p class="content reveal">So far, Gunn Student Simulator has been pretty successful; surprisingly, even some Paly students have heard of it. The game would get a “success” score on my popularity-based rubric.</p>

    <h1 class="glow reveal">Family history</h1>
    <p class="content reveal">My extended family had been in Taiwan for a while, even before the Kuomintang fled from Mainland China during the Chinese Civil War.</p>
    <img src="./yan-hui.jpg" alt="A portrait of Yán Huí" class="reveal">
    <span class="caption reveal">My dad says this guy, Yan Hui (顏回), is apparently one of our ancestors according to some generational record. He was Confucius's favourite disciple. This portrait was taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Half_Portraits_of_the_Great_Sage_and_Virtuous_Men_of_Old_-_Yan_Hui_Ziyuan_(%E9%A1%8F%E5%9B%9E_%E5%AD%90%E6%B7%B5).jpg">Wikipedia</a>; artist unknown.</span>
    <p class="content reveal">My parents immigrated to the United States from Taiwan; my mom liked Western cultures and wanted to experience a different lifestyle, while my dad just wanted a better life. Before coming to Palo Alto, my mom lived in England for 7 months for university, and my dad was in Princeton.</p>
    <img src="./family.jpg" alt="A photo of my family" class="reveal">
    <span class="caption reveal">Our family visiting Europe in 2009. I think we're posing in front of a bridge in London.</span>
    <p class="content reveal">My family history is only important to me because it makes me Asian, which makes me unfavourable to forced diversity by places like colleges. I also care that Taiwan is recognized for being independent and having access to Google. Otherwise my history is fairly unimportant.</p>
