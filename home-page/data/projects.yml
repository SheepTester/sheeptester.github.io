    This was our submission for Hard Hacks 2023, a hardware hackathon. The
    hardware part relied on a circuit board that we no longer had (it was
    borrowed from the event sponsors), plugged into the computer by a USB cable.
    The web interface would access the board's sensors using the Web Serial API.

    Since I don't have the board anymore, and neither do you, I've replaced the
    board controls with keyboard controls: left/right arrows for the left/right
    buttons, and the mouse/touchscren to swipe left and right.

    Analyzes the components of an mp4 file, and allows you to edit its fields

    The most compelling use case for this is editing the duration of the video.
    Even if you don't add any movie data, many video players, like Discord's,
    will show whatever you set the duration to, at least until near the end of
    the video when it knows how long it really is. This way, you can create
    videos that seem to be days long without going over upload limits.

    I know that it works for mp4 files produced by OBS, but it doesn't work with
    all mp4 files, like the ones taken by my phone.

    100 is assumed to have one sig fig. To specify that the trailing zeroes are
    significant, leave a trailing decimal point (e.g. 100.). This goes against
    sig fig conventions that I've seen in other contexts, like AP Physics. This
    alternate convention treats 100 as having three significant figures, and
    uses 1e2 to specify one sig fig.

  description: >-
    Kaaba is my third attempt at rendering voxels. I made it after learning
    enough WebGPU to feel confident in rendering voxels.

    The chunk size was increased to 32 in each axis, and there is more than one
    chunk by default, with randomly placed blocks to test performance by adding
    more block faces. Compared to the previous WebGL version, this verison isn't
    as powerful: there's no block placing or breaking, and block faces aren't
    culled between chunks.

    This was mostly a demo on the GPU side. Uploading data to the GPU is slow,
    so I only uploaded block positions and used instanced rendering to create 6
    vertices per face (3 vertices for each triangle in the square). I also
    adjusted how pixels are grabbed from the block texture atlas to prevent
    atlas bleeding, where a strip of the next texture in the atlas shows on the
    edges of a block face; this was an issue in the WebGL version.

    I also added post-processing effects mostly for the fun of it, since this
    was mostly a GPU learning experience.

    This was our first mini-project for CSE 110: Software Engineering at UCSD.
    It was spring 2023, and our professor, Thomas A. Powell, had recently
    discovered ChatGPT and was immediately enthralled by its potential to
    disrupt the future, so he made the quarter fortune telling themed.

    This assignment was an "exploratory project" to play around with ChatGPT and
    other generative AI models and use it to create a magic 8-ball web app. I
    think he wanted us to discover the limits of using AI to generate code, but
    we didn't really encounter any issues. We were also encouraged to take
    advantage of web features like the Web Speech API.

    Our group used ChatGPT to slap together the functionality of the app. Then,
    I came in to pimp up the design. I took this opportunity to gain more
    experience with CSS gradient animations.

    This was our final project for CSE 110: Software Engineering at UCSD. It was
    spring 2023, and our professor, Thomas A. Powell, had recently discovered
    ChatGPT and was immediately enthralled by its potential to disrupt the
    future, so he made us make a fortune-telling app.

    We were encouraged to use AI to generate code and images for the app, so
    that's what our team did. We split up our team members into different
    fortune telling concepts, and we each developed a prototype with basic
    functionality. Then, in the final week, I went through and pimped up all the
    styling so that not only did the website look cohesive, but there were also
    many fancy animations and effects. I learned more techniques for CSS
    animations, like how visibility can be "animated" to create exit animations,
    so it was somewhat worthwhile.

    As a software engineering class, we were expected to follow software
    engineering principles, such as writing tests, doing code reviews, and
    pacing our workload evenly, and supposedly this was supposed to be reflected
    in our grade. However, we did none of that. Instead, we approached it more
    like a hackathon, grinding out features in the final days of the project.

    Our TA did not care. She was dazzled by the fancy CSS animations and gave us
    an A. Meanwhile, other students who followed AGILE more meticulously
    received lower grades, which for some of them were their first B's. In
    addition to the midterm being graded on quantity over quality (i.e. long, BS
    answers), I came out of the class with one of the higher grades without
    knowing what AGILE is. Scuffed class.

    ACM at UCSD, which stands for many words that don't mean anything, is
    basicially the computer science org at UC San Diego.

    The membership portal was originally created to facilitate tracking how many
    students attended our events to prove to our student council that their
    funding wasn't going to waste. Its scope was later expanded to have a
    leaderboard for students who attended the most events, and a merch store
    where attendance points can be used to buy ACM-branded clothes and other
    swag.

    The original website was written in React, and client-side rendering wasn't
    that trendy anymore, so around the time I joined ACM, they were starting to
    rewrite and redesign the entire website in Next.js.

    I helped to speed up the rewrite, as well as making the website look fancier
    with fancy animations for the home dashboard, storefront, and user profile
    pages.

    Create a massive image that's only a few kilobytes in size. For example, a
    10000 by 10000 image (a hundred million pixels) can be expressed in a single
    12 kB PNG file.

    This is the PNG equivalent of a ZIP bomb. You can sneak a large image past a
    file size restriction, and whoever ends up trying to process the image will
    trip up deflating thousands of pixels from a single byte.

    Since these images only have one color, we can use a 2-color palette for the
    image, using one bit per pixel, or 8 pixels per byte. PNG files use the
    Deflate algorithm to compress the pixel data. Since there's only one color,
    all the bytes are the same, so we hit Deflate's maximum compression ratio of
    1000:1. All in all, up to around 8000 pixels can be represented by one byte
    in a PNG image.

    In Chinese school, we played a version like this called 一二三木頭人. The
    name translates to "one, two, three, wooden person," and I think it means
    that you're supposed to act like you're made of wood when time is up. It's
    kind of like Sneaky Statues, where after the person counts down, they turn
    around, and if they see you move, you lose. Your goal is to tag the person
    counting down.

    Squid Game also adapted this, but they sing a song to count down instead.
    Both Asian versions let you know how much time you have to move, while this
    American version does not.
