Although in javascripts/audio-editor/audio, these files are actually used for
[javascripts/randomised-music.html](https://sheeptester.github.io/javascripts/randomised-music.html),
not the audio editor. I put the files here to signify that they're from Scratch,
as most of the other files in here are.
